Lab 4 Readme

For my creative portion this lab, I implemented three features.

The first feature is the ability to load movie data from movies that have been favorited. Movies in the favorites list can be clicked on and the user will be taken to a screen that displays the movie title, release date, rating, and language, as well as a higher resolution image of the movie poster. (Same behavior as clicking a movie in search and getting the info, except with favorites). I implemented this feature by creating a struct called "fav", which help a movie title, image string, release date, rating, and original language. I then used an sqlite3 database to store the movie data and fetch the movie data into the "fav" struct, and then appended the fav struct, with the fetched data, into an array. This array contains all the info of each favorited movie, and the respective data for whatever movie is selected is prepared before the movie info view controller is sequed. I implemented this feature because I thought it would be very useful for users to be able to directly view details of their favorite movies rather than having to search them up again.

The second feature is displaying the movie posters in the "favorites" tab. Previously, only the titles were displayed, but I made it so the titles along with their images are displayed. If no valid image is found for a movie, a default "image not found" image is displayed instead. I implemented this using the arrays and sqlite3 database mentioned above. I added this feature in because many movies have the same or similar titles, so including the poster in the favorites tab would help the user distinguish between movies.

The final feature I added is a "search history" function. The user can click the "history" button at the top left of the "movies" screen and it will take them to a modal which displays their previous searches in a table view. The user can then click on a search entry, and it will copy that entry into their keyboard. Upon going back to the "movies" page, the user can paste their search entry in and search for movies. I implemented this by creating an array of strings containing all searches inputted by the user. Whenever the user executes a search, whatever they typed is appended to that array. Then, I created a new view controller where the array data is sent to. This view controller has a table view that displays all elements of the search history array. Whenever a cell in the table is clicked, the respective string is copied using UIPasteboard. I added this feature because I thought it would be helpful for the user to be able to navigate through their past searches and re-search for them.
