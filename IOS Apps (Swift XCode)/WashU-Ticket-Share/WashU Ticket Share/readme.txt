WashU Ticket Share ReadME

Group Members: Michael Yang, Jade Wang, Jonathan Song, Lily Cohen

Basic app overview: Our app is a platform for users to buy and sell tickets for various events. Users can sign up with their email and set a displayname and password, and then login with their registered email and password. Upon logging in, a user is able to view all tickets that are currently for sale. When a user taps a ticket, it brings up a detailed view of it, showing details about the event, the ticket's price, the seller's name, the date and time of the event, the date and time the ticket was posted, as well as an option to message the seller. Upon tapping the "message <seller>" button, the user will be taken to a chat room where they can direct message the seller to figure out a payment method and how they want the ticket to be sent to them. Upon completion of the sale, the seller is able to click on their ticket and choose from a list of users who have contacted them for that specific ticket. They can select the user they sold it to and mark the ticket as "sold", removing it from the ticket listing and placing it in their profile as a successful transation. Upon buying a ticket, the buying user will see the details of the ticket(s) they have purchased in the "inbox" tab. Through this tab they can click on each ticket and will be prompted to confirm if the transaction was successful.

NOTE: In our initial presentation we proposed having a calendar/map feature to further organize the tickets available. However, one of our group members dropped the class early on, so we were forced to scrap this idea.
