# Description of game
The game is called snither.io, and is essentially our attempt at remaking the popular online game slither.io. Much like the original game, this game involves controlling a snake that follows the mouse cursor and grows when it eats food and dies when it collides with another snake. The player can speed up the snake by holding down space or mouse click, causing the snake to shrink in size in the process. 

# More features
As of now the game is only singleplayer with AI snakes. A live scoreboard is available for each game, showing the top 5 scores. An all-time leaderboard is also present displaying the 10 highest scores achieved by players. When a player dies, their score is sent to the server and if it is high enough it will be displayed on this leaderboard. 

# User accounts
Players have the option to play quickly using a username of their choice, as long as that username does not belong to an already registered account. If the player wishes they can create a permanent username by registering for an account. Then, once registered they can sign in and begin playing. Player who are registered are able to change the color of their snake.
